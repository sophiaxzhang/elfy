## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If you see "Failed to load suggestions":**
1. Check your OpenAI API key is correct
2. Make sure the server is running
3. Check the server console for errors
4. Verify your internet connection

### **If the AI button doesn't appear:**
1. Make sure you've restarted your app
2. Check that the navigation was updated correctly
3. Look for any TypeScript errors in the console

### **If suggestions seem generic:**
1. Try different contexts (weekend, morning, etc.)
2. Use different child ages
3. The AI learns from your prompts!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Better Suggestions:**
- Use specific contexts: "weekend morning", "rainy day", "before bedtime"
- Try different ages to see how suggestions change
- The AI considers time of day and context automatically

### **Integration Ideas:**
- Add the AI button to other screens
- Customize the prompt for your specific needs
- Add more contextual information (weather, child's interests)
